  LCD Library - setCursor

 Demonstrates the use of a 16x2 LCD display.  The LCD
 library works with all LCD displays that are compatible with the
 Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of them out there, and you
 can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface.

 This sketch prints to all the positions of the LCD using the
 setCursor() method:

// include the library code:
#include <LCD.h>

// initialize the library by associating any needed LCD interface pin
// with the Arduino pin number it is connected to
const int rs = 12, en = 11, d4 = 5, d5 = 4, d6 = 3, d7 = 2;
LCD lcd(0x27);

// these constants won't change.  But you can change the size of
// your LCD using them:
const int numRows = 2;
const int numCols = 16;

void setup() {
  // set up the LCD's number of columns and rows:
  lcd.begin(numCols, numRows);
}

void loop() {
  // loop from ASCII 'a' to ASCII 'z':
  for (int thisLetter = 'a'; thisLetter <= 'z'; thisLetter++) {
    // loop over the columns:
    for (int  thisRow = 0; thisRow < numRows; thisRow++) {
      // loop over the rows:
      for (int thisCol = 0; thisCol < numCols; thisCol++) {
        // set the cursor position:
        lcd.setCursor(thisCol, thisRow);
        // print the letter:
        lcd.write(thisLetter);
        delay(200);
